# BackThatNasUp
A configurable script to run backups in your environment

This is still VERY much a work in progress

# Broad strokes
Just a place for me to get the overall idea down to so I stay on track.
- Configuration file defining...
  * What directories you want backed up (However many that may be)
  * Option to pass encryption parameters (Drive on the other end needs to be unlocked?)
  * SSH key filepaths
  * Defining a secondary server to push the most recent push to (Like a local and remote backup)
  * Probably not happening any time soon, but looking into keeping a set amount of old backups and defining that structure in the config file.
  * Other stuff I forgot I thought of last night
- Command line arguments allowing you to run things to bypass the config file if wanted and other stuff like just running a dry run


yada yada yada
